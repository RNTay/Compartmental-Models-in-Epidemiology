# Compartmental-Models-in-Epidemiology

Code to simulate (simple) epidemics with compartmental models.

## SIR-model.R
SIR = Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered  
This model assumes that the population is:  
1. homogeneous  
2. well-mixed  
i.e. all susceptible individuals face the same risk of infection per unit time.


## SEIRD-model.R
SEIRD = Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered, Deceased
